This theme includes the [@astrojs/mdx](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/) integration installed and configured in your `astro.config.mjs` configuration file.

## what is MDX?

MDX is a special variant of Markdown that supports embedded JavaScript and JSX syntax. This unlocks the ability to [mix JavaScript and UI components into your Markdown content](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#mdx-features) for things like interactive charts or alerts.

## example

Here you have a example of how to import and use a UI component inside of MDX. When you open this page in the browser, you should see the clickable button below.

```jsx
<button onclick="alert('clicked!')">
  Embedded component in MDX
</button>
```

<button onclick="alert('clicked!')">
  Embedded component in MDX
</button>
